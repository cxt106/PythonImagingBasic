    "## Background knowledge: what do you need to know to get the most out of this workshop?\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is tailored toward researchers with a working knowledge of interactive programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and R. If you are a beginner, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with some basic programming concepts before you begin. In this case, Google, or any other search engine of choice, is your friend! We will be using Python, so you will need to be able to understand and make use of the following Python concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data can be stored in **variables** through **assignment**.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 4\n",
    ">>> b = 'test'\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "'test'\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Variables hold data of different **types** (e.g., strings, integers, 64-bit floating-point numbers, etc.).\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> type(a)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    ">>> type(b)\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Data can be stored as **lists** and these can also be assigned to variables.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> c = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>> type(c)\n",
    "<class 'list'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. **Indexing** can be used to select specific positions in a list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> c[0]\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> c[3]\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Functions** can take one or more **arguments**, do something with them, and return a value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def add(a, b):\n",
    "...     sum = a + b\n",
    "...     return sum\n",
    "... \n",
    ">>> add(1 ,3)\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> add(34, 92)\n",
    "126\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. need to say something here about objects, methods, and dot notation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Python's functionality can be extended through **packages** and **modules**.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> a = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
    ">>> plt.hist(a)\n",
    "(array([1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1.]), array([1. , 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2. , 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3. ]), <a list of 10 Patch objects>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the topics above are confusing, it is strongly recommended that you check out a Python tutorial. The [Software Carpentries](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) website might be a good place to start."

    "## Tools we will be using\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use three software tools in addition to Python for this workshop: git, conda, and jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "[git](https://git-scm.com) is only used in this workshop to copy the course notes and code to your local computer, although it is a very powerful tool for managing your projects!\n",
    "\n",
    "[conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is a tool used for two purposes: to create [environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for your projects and to manage Python packages. It will be a very good idea to read up on conda before you begin this course, spefically how to use environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "[jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is a tool for developing your code in \"notebooks\" (file extension \\*.ipynb) in a web browser. This course is based around a series of such notebooks (you are looking at a notebook now!). The main utility of using notebooks for image analysis is that you can save all of your output on the same page as your code, which helps you, and your collaborators, to follow the steps of an analysis."

    "    conda install scikit-image numpy jupyter nb_conda\n",
